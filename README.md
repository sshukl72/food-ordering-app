 - Props is like a argument to the function. It's an object that contains data passed into the component when it is rendered. 

 - Props is Object which is passed in the  component. It contains all the data that we need to render our components.

 - Config Driven UI:-
 - A config file that contains the structure of the app. This includes information about how to render different components, their properties and any dependencies.

 It is data  driven approach where the UI of an application is generated based on a configuration file(data from backend in json). A config file that contains all the information.


Whenever we loop and use map in functional component we have to give key  prop. 

React always says that never use array index as key in props.

Index is a key is an anti pattern.
